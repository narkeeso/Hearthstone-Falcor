# hearthstone-falcor
A hearthstone deck creator using Falcor, RxJS Observables, internal and external services.

## Purpose
To experiment with and learn Falcor while using data from my favorite game. The goal is to demonstrate aggregating multiple services to improve data fetching on the browser.

## Goals
- Build out all needed routes for fetching data needed for building a deck
- Build the database service used to save created decks
- Build a simple interface for deck creation
- Dockerize services
- Have more than 9 deck slots ;)
